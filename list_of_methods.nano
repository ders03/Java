Given a class,  
Given the method operator "::", which behaves exactl as lambda, does not provide delegate
<Class>::<method> , ex: System.out::println

List<Class<Type>> list = new ArrayList<>(); 
Class<Type> methodDef = System.out::println; 

better way to do it: 
	define methods in class constructor 
	then can be called by Class::method
